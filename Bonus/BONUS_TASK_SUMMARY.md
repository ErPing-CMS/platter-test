## Implementation Details

### Shopify Schema
The section includes a comprehensive schema that allows merchants to:
- Set the section title
- Select which collection to display
- Control the number of products shown
- Configure the "Shop All" link
- Enable/disable the mobile "Show More" button
- Customize button text

### Product Tagging System
The implementation uses Shopify's tagging system to display badges:
- Products tagged with `best-seller` will display the "BEST SELLER" badge
- Products tagged with `discount` will display the "SAVE 15%" badge

### Responsive Design
The section maintains the same responsive behavior as the original implementation:
- Desktop: Horizontal scrolling product gallery
- Mobile: Grid layout with "Show More" button functionality

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
All files have been written with cross-browser compatibility in mind, including:
- Vendor prefixes for CSS properties
- Fallbacks for modern CSS features
- Polyfills for JavaScript functionality

## How to Use
1. Copy the `.liquid`, `.js`, and `.css` files to your Shopify theme
2. Follow the instructions in `SHOPIFY_INTEGRATION.md` to integrate them
3. Tag your products appropriately in the Shopify Admin
4. Add the section to your theme using the Shopify Customizer

This implementation maintains all the functionality of the original Best Sellers gallery while making it compatible with Shopify's section system.
